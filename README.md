```bash
gsed -i "/localcommithash/c \\\tlocalcommithash = \"$(git rev-parse HEAD)\"" config.toml
gsed -i "/localcommitdate/c \\\tlocalcommitdate = \"$(git log --pretty=format:"%cd" $(git rev-parse HEAD) -1)\"" config.toml
gsed -i "/localcommitcomment/c \\\tlocalcommitcomment = \"$(git log --pretty=format:"%s" $(git rev-parse HEAD) -1)\"" config.toml
